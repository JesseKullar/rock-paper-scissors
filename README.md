# rock-paper-scissors
Part of a series of projects to attain my Machine Learning certification in Python. See Following: https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/jessekullar/machine-learning-with-python-v7

This project uses a Markov Chain to play rock paper scissors against an AI. The code is able to determine the likelyhood of the opponents next move based on its prior moves and succeeds an accuracy of at least 60%. I would like to improve this code in the future by adding a reward feature for the bot as well as a decay feature so it "forgets" over time.
